# VOLUNTEER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is a dotnet application that connects volunteers with a wide range of volunteering opportunities and allows volunteer recruiters to easily find talent to work with.
### Problem Statement:

Public sector organizations such as non-profits, government agencies, and community groups often rely on volunteers to carry out their essential work. However, managing volunteers can be a time-consuming and challenging task, involving tasks such as recruiting, scheduling, and tracking hours. Unfortunately, many organizations still rely on manual, paper-based systems or outdated software, which can lead to missed volunteer opportunities, lost productivity, and decreased engagement from volunteers.
